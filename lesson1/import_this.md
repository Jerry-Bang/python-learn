   **Beautiful is better than ugly.**
   **美好胜于丑陋**
   
   **Explicit is better than implicit.**
   **清楚胜于含混**
   
   **Simple is better than complex.**
   **简明胜于复杂**
   
   **Complex is better than complicated.**
   **复杂胜于晦涩**
   
   **Flat is better than nested.**
   **平直胜于曲折**
   
   **Sparse is better than dense.**
   **疏散胜于密集**
   
   **Readability counts.**
   **重在易读**
   
   **Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.**
   **遵守规则,概莫能外**
    
   **Although practicality beats purity.**
   **纵然实践会击败真理**
   
   **Errors should never pass silently.**
   **错误却万不容姑息**
    
   **Unless explicitly silenced.**
   **除非心意已冷**
   
   **In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess。**
   **疑窦丛生,拒绝猜测**
   
   **There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.**
   **宁折不弯,探寻正道**
   
   **Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.**
   **路漫漫其修远兮,吾将上下而求索**
   
   **Now is better than never.**
   **悟以往之不谏,知来者之可追**
    
   **Although never is often better than *right* now.**
   **前路不明,似应放弃**
   
   **If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.**
   **晦涩难懂,弃之可也**
   
   **If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.**
   **简明易懂,方可存留**
   
   **Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!**
   **命名空间,多多益善**
